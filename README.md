Challenge

 

Below is a Github link for an iOS annotation app that works for pdf files. 

https://github.com/smartmaxdev/PDFKit-Demo

 

This project has three issues that need to be solved

·         Currently, it can only handle one page document – the code needs to be fixed to handle multiple pages

·         Left to right horizontal swipe to make annotation cancels the process

·         This is not consistent but the annotation drops by a few pixels (vertical moves down) when you remove your finger after making  shape

 

Optional issue

·         Annotation does not handle curves well. The shapes are not smooth. See if you can smoothen the curves?
